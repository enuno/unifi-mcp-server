# Development Workflow

## Before Starting Work

1. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Review existing patterns in similar files
4. If work involves Claude commands/agents or `.claude`/`docs/claude` assets, load `docs/claude/CLAUDE.md` plus the relevant manuals (01-07) before making changes so Cursor and Claude guidance stay aligned.

## During Development

1. Write tests first (TDD approach)
2. Implement feature following patterns above
3. Run tests frequently: `pytest -v`
4. Check types: `mypy src/`
5. Format code: `black src/ tests/` and `isort src/ tests/`

## Before Committing

1. Run full test suite: `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`
2. Ensure coverage ≥80%: Check coverage report
3. Run linter: `ruff check src/ tests/ --fix`
4. Type check: `mypy src/`
5. Run pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit run --all-files`
6. Update documentation if needed

## Commit Message Format

Follow Conventional Commits:

```
<type>: <short summary>

<optional body>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `style`, `chore`

Examples:

```
feat: add DPI statistics tool for bandwidth analysis
fix: correct device restart timeout handling
docs: update API.md with WiFi management tools
test: add integration tests for port forwarding
refactor: simplify client blocking logic
```
