# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- **Critical startup bug (issue #42)**: `ImportError: cannot import 'config' from 'agnost'` prevented the server from starting for all users, even when `AGNOST_ENABLED=false`. Root cause: `agnost` v0.1.13 removed the `config` export, and the old code imported it unconditionally at module top-level. Fixed by moving agnost imports inside the conditional block — they now only execute when `AGNOST_ENABLED=true` and `AGNOST_ORG_ID` is set, and any import or runtime failure is gracefully caught and logged as a warning.

### Tests

- Added `tests/unit/test_main_agnost_import.py` with 3 regression tests covering missing `config` export, agnost not installed, and agnost disabled scenarios.
- Test count: 1,159 passing (up from 1,156).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-18

### Added

**RADIUS & Guest Portal — Complete CRUD (4 new tools)**

- `get_radius_account` — Retrieve a single RADIUS account by ID; password field auto-redacted
- `update_radius_account` — Update username, password, VLAN, tunnel type, enabled status, and notes; confirm/dry-run support
- `get_hotspot_package` — Retrieve a single hotspot package by ID
- `update_hotspot_package` — Update name, duration, bandwidth limits, quotas, price, currency, and enabled status; confirm/dry-run support

These complete full CRUD for RADIUS accounts and hotspot packages. Phase 6 (Enhanced RADIUS & Guest Portal) is now feature-complete.

### Fixed

- **QoS Tools**: Fixed runtime `TypeError` in 6 `audit_action` calls in `qos.py` that incorrectly used `action=` keyword argument instead of the required `action_type=`. Affected `create_qos_profile`, `update_qos_profile`, `configure_smart_queue`, `disable_smart_queue`, `create_traffic_route`, `update_traffic_route`. Would have crashed at runtime whenever audit logging was enabled.
- **Site Manager**: Removed duplicate `@require_site_manager` decorator on `get_sdwan_config_status` (was applied twice — redundant and confusing).
- **Topology Tests**: Fixed 6 `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'AsyncMockMixin._execute_mock_call' was never awaited` warnings in the topology test suite. Root cause: 6 tests called `client.settings.get_integration_path()` through an auto-created `AsyncMock` (because `mock_instance.settings` was not set). Fixed by adding `mock_instance.settings = mock_settings` to each affected test.
- **Backup Client**: Added 3 missing methods to `UniFiClient` that `backups.py` calls at runtime:
  - `get_restore_status(operation_id)` — returns `not_supported` stub (endpoint not in UniFi API)
  - `configure_backup_schedule(...)` — `PUT /proxy/network/api/s/{site}/rest/backup/schedule`
  - `get_backup_schedule(site_id)` — `GET /proxy/network/api/s/{site}/rest/backup/schedule`
  Previously these silently fell back to an `AttributeError` handler in `backups.py`.

### Tests

- Added `TestUniFiClientBackupMethods` with 5 tests covering the new backup client methods.
- Test count: 1,156 passing (up from 1,128).
- Zero `RuntimeWarning` coroutine warnings (down from 6).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-16

### 🎉 Feature Release - Port Profile Management & Security Hardening

This release adds comprehensive switch port management capabilities, fixes critical security vulnerabilities, corrects API endpoint issues, and improves code quality across the codebase.

### Added

**Port Profile & Switch Port Management (8 new tools)**

- `list_port_profiles` - Paginated listing of switch port profiles with filtering

  - VLAN configuration (native, trunk, excluded VLANs)
  - 802.1X port-based authentication
  - LLDP-MED voice VLAN support
  - Port speed/duplex configuration
  - Port isolation and storm control

- Replaced PII in `SECURITY.md` (placeholder emails → GitHub Security Advisories)
- MAC address sanitization in logs and error messages (masked to `aa:bb:cc:xx:xx:xx`)
- Git history verified clean - no secrets ever committed

### Fixed

**API Endpoint & Payload Corrections**

- **RADIUS Tools** - Corrected endpoints and field names:
  - Profile endpoints: `/integration/v1/.../radius/profiles` → `/ea/sites/.../rest/radiusprofile`
  - Account endpoints: `/integration/v1/.../radius/accounts` → `/ea/sites/.../rest/account`
  - Password field: `password` → `x_password` (actual UniFi API field)
  - VLAN field: `vlan_id` → `vlan`
  - Auto-populate `tunnel_type`/`tunnel_medium_type` when VLAN specified
  - Secrets redacted (`***REDACTED***`) in all responses
  - Fixed list response handling at 5 locations (prevents `AttributeError` on `.get()`)

- **Firewall Tools** - New payload fields for proper rule creation:
  - Added `ruleset` (default `WAN_IN`) and `rule_index` (default `2000`)
  - Added `src_networkconf_id`/`dst_networkconf_id` with type variants (default `None`, typed `str | None`)
  - Added connection state flags: `state_established`, `state_related`, `state_new`, `state_invalid`
  - Added traffic `logging` flag
  - Fixed parameter names: `source`/`destination` → `src_address`/`dst_address`

- **WLAN Tools** - New creation parameters:
  - Added `networkconf_id` - associate SSID with specific network
  - Added `ap_group_ids`/`ap_group_mode` - per-AP-group broadcasting
  - Added `wlan_bands` - band selection (`2g`, `5g`, or both)
  - Added IoT optimization and minimum data rate controls

- **Network Config Tools** - Fixed VLAN field name (`vlan_id` → `vlan`)

- **All Tools** - Boolean parameter coercion (`"true"` → `True`) for MCP JSON-RPC compatibility

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixed `dry_run` requiring `confirm=True` - `validate_confirmation()` now accepts `dry_run` parameter
- Fixed missing `DuplicateResourceError` exception (was imported but not defined)
- Fixed RADIUS response crashes where list responses were passed to `.get()` or Pydantic constructors
- Updated all 55 call sites across 16 tool modules for dry_run fix

**Code Quality**

- Added full type hints to `coerce_bool(value: bool | str | None) -> bool`
- Added full type hints to `validate_confirmation(confirm: bool | str | None, operation: str, dry_run: bool | str = False) -> None`
- Port profile tools validate responses through Pydantic models before returning
- Fixed import ordering (isort) across all files

### Changed
