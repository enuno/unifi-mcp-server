# UniFi MCP Server Development Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the modernization of the UniFi MCP Server. The primary goal is to align the server's capabilities with the latest advancements in the UniFi ecosystem, ensuring its continued relevance and value to users.

The immediate priorities are the implementation of **Zone-Based Firewall (ZBF)** and **Traffic Flows API** support, which are critical for users of UniFi Network Application 9.0 and above. These features represent a fundamental shift in UniFi's networking paradigm, and their absence in the MCP Server is a significant gap.

The development plan is structured around a phased rollout, with clear version milestones and technical objectives. The timeline for major milestones is as follows:

- **Q1 2025:** Introduction of modern firewall and monitoring capabilities.
- **Q2 2025:** Implementation of policy automation and next-generation networking features.
- **H2 2025:** Expansion into a multi-application platform with enterprise-grade features.

This plan is ambitious yet achievable, and it is designed to provide a clear path forward for the project, its contributors, and its users.
